# The `tool` Folder

Every tool that you need to use will be in the `tool` folder.

1. `deploy.sh`: Deploys MFL. Of course, I can only do this;
1. `format_and_fix.sh`: Formats and fixes all code in `lib`;
1. `generate_code.sh`: Runs `dart run build_runner build` to generate automatically generated code;
1. `initialize.sh`: Install dependencies and run build_runner to be able to launch the Storyboard;
1. `test.sh`: Tests all code and generates the code coverage LCOV html.
