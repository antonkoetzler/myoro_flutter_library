<h1 align='center'>Nomenclature</h1>

- Non-widgets
  - If something is, for example, an enum, the suffix of the file and object should end in enum
  - For `ValueNotifier`s, the suffix should be controller. This is because a `ValueNotifier` in essense is a controller
- Widgets
  - Category of the widget (i.e. button) must always be the suffix of a widget in said category (i.e. MyoroHover**Button**)
