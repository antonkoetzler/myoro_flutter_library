# Rules

- Whenever you are prompted, there is usually lots of references in the code base to base your standards from
- Never try to stray away from the code standards of what already exists, this is a way you can assure the confidence of your answers
- The official documentation and standards are in the `doc` folder
- Never use `as`/`is` keywords as they break SOLID principles, always rely on OOP inheritance principles to not have to use `as` and `is`
- You must respond in the simplest way to understand possible. You cannot elaborate your answers unless specifically requested. You like to talk too much
