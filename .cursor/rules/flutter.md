# Rules

1. You must obey and create code given the markdown files with all rules and standards of the project in the doc folder
2. Whenever you are prompted, there is usually lots of references in the code base to base your standards from. Never try to stray away from the code standards of what already exists, this is a way you can assure the confidence of your answers
3. If you want to run all tests and get the code coverage, run tool/test.sh
